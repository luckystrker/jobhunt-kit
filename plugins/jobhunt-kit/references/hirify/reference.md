# hirify CLI reference

Written for an agent. Every command, what it costs, what it answers, and how it refuses.

Commands are a noun and a verb: the noun is the thing you are working with, the verb is what you do
to it. `hirify <noun>` on its own lists the verbs that noun takes. `login`, `logout`, `auth` and
`intro` stay single words: they are not operations on a thing.

**This file describes the CLI, not the state of Hirify.** It is installed with the skill and never
updated afterwards, so it names no filter, no limit and no number that our side can change. Those
come from commands: `hirify filter guide` for filters, `hirify account show` for what is left,
`hirify account show --json` for the plan and the limits. Where this file would have quoted one, it
names the command instead.

Add `--json` to any command to get the server's payload verbatim instead of the text below.
`--fields a,b` narrows a compact answer to the fields you name and never adds one the answer did not
carry. Parse `--json`; do not parse the text, it is written for a person to read.

**Exit codes are stable.** `0` is success, `1` an ordinary error, and `2` means this Hirify speaks a
newer manifest than your CLI can read - update the CLI. Every failure also writes one line to stderr
beginning with `hirify: `. Branch on the code rather than on the message text.

Set `HIRIFY_DEBUG=1` in front of a command to also get the server's own answer on stderr. Use it
when you need to report a problem; the normal output never contains raw payloads.

## Cost model

| Command | Cost | Reversible |
|---|---|---|
| `account show`, `feed list`, `feed show`, `vacancy search`, `profile list`, `webhook list` | free: they spend nothing | reading only |
| `vacancy read` | 1 vacancy open from a generous daily allowance, repeats the same day are free | reading only |
| `vacancy reveal` | 1 reveal, repeats on the same vacancy are free | reading only |
| `vacancy apply` | counts against a daily allowance of its own | **no**: a real application reaches a real person |
| `feed create`, `feed deliver`, `webhook create` | free | changes the user's account |
| `feedback send` | free | a ticket is filed |
| `filter guide` | free: it spends nothing | reading only |
| `api call` | whatever the capability it calls costs | whatever that capability does |

Free is not unlimited: every command is rate-limited, reading more loosely than searching. A burst
answers `429` and names the seconds to wait. The numbers are the server's and change without this
file: `hirify account show --json`, block `limits`.

Three budgets run out, and they are separate. Vacancy opens are the allowance `vacancy read` draws
on. Reveals are the scarce one. Applications have a daily allowance of their own - `vacancy apply`
is not the free step it looks like. All three are in `hirify account show`, and in
`hirify account show --json` under
`quota.read`, `quota.reveal` and `quota.apply`.

**No number for any of them is written in this file.** Each block carries `limit`, `used` and
`remaining` as the server currently has them; that is the only place they are true, and this file
outlives every change to them.

## Signing in

`hirify login` opens a browser and needs a person. Never run it yourself: ask the user to run it.
It stores access in `~/.config/hirify/auth.json` (mode 600) and renews it without asking again.
`hirify logout` forgets it. On CI or a server: `hirify auth <key>`, or `HIRIFY_KEY` in the
environment, which wins over a stored sign-in.

Permissions are fixed when the user signs in and cannot be added afterwards. A 403 naming a missing
permission means the user signed in before that permission existed: they have to run `hirify login`
again.

## Reading

```bash
hirify account show
hirify feed list
hirify feed show <id> [--limit N] [--page N]
hirify vacancy search "<phrase>" [--<criterion> <value>]... [--limit N] [--page N]
```

`account show` reports the plan, the reveals left, the vacancy opens left today, the applications
left today, and reveal usage over 7 and 30 days. Check it before spending any of the three. The
allowances come as one number each, not as a fraction.

`feed list` lists saved searches as `<id> <name>`, with `(off)` for an inactive one. `feed show
<id>` returns that feed's vacancies, using the criteria saved in the feed.

`vacancy search` is a conduit. The words are the phrase; every option is forwarded to the API under
the name you gave it, so the criteria are the server's and this CLI holds no copy of them to fall
behind. `--limit` is the page size and arrives as the API's `per_page`; `--json` steers the CLI and
is never sent. An option repeated is joined with a comma, which is how the site sends a criterion
with several values.

**The criteria and the method come from `hirify filter guide`, and only from there.** Do not guess
names or values. The final search refuses an unknown criterion, while a misspelt value can return
an empty list that looks like an honest answer.

Both `feed show` and `vacancy search` page with `--page N`. The last line of a list says which page
you are on and offers the next one when there may be another.

Vacancy cards print as:

```
<slug>
  <title> · <company or "company hidden">
  [<remote> · <format> · <employment> · <english> · <salary> · verified]
```

Cards never carry contacts. `company hidden` means the name is revealed by `vacancy reveal`, not
that the field is broken.

## filter guide: what search can filter on

```bash
hirify filter guide
```

Prints the filter guide the server writes: which criteria search accepts, what their values are,
and the method for turning what a person wants into a filter that works. Free, and it needs
`agent:read` like the other reading commands.

The server derives it from the same source the site's own search reads, so it cannot fall behind
the search. That is the whole point: nothing in this package writes filter names down, because a
list written here goes stale silently and an agent acts on it without knowing.

The guide requires a preview before a filter is used. For the CLI, invoke the preview capability
through the generic command:

```bash
hirify api call filters.preview --data '{"filters":{"search":"product manager"},"mode":"compact","per_page":20}'
```

Inspect the cards and `meta.total`, refine when needed, and only then run `hirify vacancy search`
with the same criteria. Preview and search use the same search implementation.

`--json` gives `{"guide": "<text>"}`. The text is written for a model to read, so pass it through
rather than summarising it.

A server that does not serve the guide yet answers plainly: `this Hirify server does not serve the
filter guide yet.` Then the criteria have to come from the user, not from a guess.

## vacancy read: one vacancy in full

```bash
hirify vacancy read <slug>
```

The card plus everything else the vacancy page shows: area, grade, skills, location, when it was
posted, the page address, and the description as text. This is the command that decides fit, and it
is deliberately cheap.

It costs one vacancy open from the daily allowance, and the same vacancy read again the same day
costs nothing. The output states whether an open was used and how many are left.

The last line before that says which way to apply:

- `Apply on Hirify: hirify vacancy apply <slug>` - the vacancy is hosted here.
- `Where to apply: hirify vacancy reveal <slug> (uses 1 reveal)` - it came from elsewhere, so the
  application goes to that destination rather than through Hirify. Take this from `vacancy read`
  rather than finding out from a refusal on `vacancy apply`.

Contacts, the apply destination and where the vacancy came from are never in this answer. That is
what `vacancy reveal` is for.

With `--json`, `data.description` is HTML (`data.description_format` says so) and the text output is
the same content flattened for a terminal. `charged` and `quota` sit next to `data`.

Refusals: `there is no vacancy with that slug.`, and, when the day's opens are spent, `you have
opened as many vacancies today as the daily allowance covers.` - feeds and search still work then,
and so does any vacancy already read today.

## vacancy reveal: where to apply

```bash
hirify vacancy reveal <slug>
```

Spends 1 reveal and returns the company, its LinkedIn page when known, and one or more
contacts: an address, a form URL, or a link. Revealing the same vacancy again returns the same thing
and spends nothing, so a repeat is safe. The output states whether a reveal was used and how many
are left.

Shortlist with `vacancy read` first. A reveal spent at random is spent.

## vacancy apply: only on Hirify

```bash
hirify profile list
hirify vacancy apply <slug> [--profile <id>] [--cover "<text>"]
```

`profile list` lists what the user can apply with: `<profile_id> <name> [status · incomplete]`.

`vacancy apply` sends an application through Hirify. **Ask the user first, every time, and show
what you are sending.** It cannot be undone, and it counts against a daily allowance of its own:
`hirify account show` reports what is left, and `hirify account show --json` carries it as
`quota.apply` with `limit`, `used` and `remaining` as the server currently has them.

- `--profile` is required when the user has more than one profile. With exactly one, it is chosen
  automatically. Never guess between several.
- `--cover` is optional. There is a length ceiling and the server owns it: if the letter is too
  long, the answer says so. Write it from what the user told you and show them the draft first.

Answers:

- success: `Applied. Application <id>, status <status>.` Nothing follows up: the recruiter replies
  where they choose to.
- `there is no vacancy with that slug.`
- a refusal in the server's own words, which covers archived, flagged, someone else's profile, and
  **vacancies not hosted on Hirify**. For those, use `vacancy reveal` and apply at the destination it
  returns.
- `the application could not be sent right now.` means our side failed, not the user's data.

## Saved searches and delivery

```bash
hirify feed create "<name>" [--filters '<json>'] [--telegram|--no-telegram] [--webhook <id>]
hirify feed deliver <id> [--telegram|--no-telegram] [--webhook <id>|--no-webhook]
hirify webhook list
hirify webhook create "<name>" <url>
```

These change the user's account. Propose, get a yes, then run them.

`--filters` takes the same criteria the site's filter form produces, as JSON, and the names come
from `hirify filter guide`. Omitting it saves a feed with no criteria, which means "send me
everything" and is legal.

`webhook create` answers with the endpoint and a **secret shown once**. Hand it to the user
immediately and tell them to store it: it signs every delivery and cannot be shown again.

## feedback send

```bash
hirify feedback send <bug|feature> "<title>" --body "<text>" [--vacancy <slug>]
```

Both a title and a body are required, and the CLI says so before sending anything. Their lengths
are the server's rule, not the CLI's: too short or too long comes back as the server's own sentence
naming which. Ask the user before sending and send their words. The answer gives a ticket number,
or says there is no number yet. There is no page to open, nothing writes back to the user, and no
reply, fix or date is promised. Report that it was passed on and stop there.

Refusals: too many reports in a short time (with the wait in seconds), the channel being off, or the
report not being accepted.

## api call: any capability by its id

```bash
hirify api call <capability-id> [--data '<json>'] [--fields a,b] [--json]
```

Invokes any capability Hirify lists in its manifest, by its id, and prints the answer. It is here so
that a job this CLI has no named command for is a detour rather than a dead end. The ids are the
ones the manifest publishes; the named commands above cover the common ones, and this reaches the
rest.

```bash
hirify api call account.status
hirify api call vacancies.search --data '{"search":"go","per_page":5}'
hirify api call feeds.create --data '{"name":"Senior Go","filters":{}}'
```

- Inputs go in `--data` as one JSON object. Each value is routed where the manifest places it: into
  the path, the query string, or the body. A `--data` that is not JSON is refused before anything is
  sent, and a capability the manifest does not list is named as unknown without a request being made.
- The answer is rendered compactly by default, so it reads without a parser: a vacancy card shows the
  same shortlist fields `vacancy search` prints, and any other shape shows the fields the server
  returned, one per line. `--fields a,b` narrows that to the fields you name.
- `--json` gives the raw canonical answer instead, refusals included, so what you parse is the
  server's own payload rather than a sentence of ours. On a refusal the raw answer is printed and the
  exit code is non-zero.

**Prefer a named command where one exists.** This one carries none of what they know: it will not
tell you that a call costs a reveal, and it will send a real application as readily as
`vacancy apply` would. The permission rules do not change: ask the user before anything that sends,
saves or configures.

## Failure modes worth knowing

| Message | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `you are not signed in yet` | no stored access | ask the user to run `hirify login` |
| `your sign-in is no longer valid` | the session expired past renewal | ask the user to run `hirify login` |
| `the key was not accepted (401)` | a manual key was revoked or truncated | new key from the account page |
| `no access (403)` | missing permission, or the plan does not cover agent access | sign in again, or check the plan |
| `you have no reveals left right now` | the reveal budget is spent | reading still works; `hirify account show` has what is left |
| `you have sent as many applications today...` | the daily allowance for applying is spent | reading and revealing still work; `hirify account show` has what is left |
| `you have opened as many vacancies today...` | the day's vacancy opens are spent | feeds, search and anything already read today still work |
| `too many requests in a short time` | asking faster than the API allows | wait the seconds it names, then carry on |
| `something went wrong on our side` | our fault, not the request | retry in a minute |
| an empty list from a filtered search | usually a criterion name or value that does not exist | check the name against what the server accepts, do not keep guessing |
| `the network seems to be unavailable` | no connection | retry |
| `hirify <noun> has no verb "..."` | a command name this CLI does not have | the message lists the verbs that noun takes; read it rather than guessing again |
